I didn’t know today would be day 0. It’s actually my mother’s birthday. She’s turning seventy-two and we are due to go over to her place for lunch. 

I’ve had a sore throat for the last two days and am having second thoughts about going -- exposing my mother to viruses and all that. I call my brother for advice. He doesn’t live nearby so visits fall on me. My dad, who has Alzheimer’s probably won’t remember it’s her birthday. Eventually I relent and say I will only come if we agree no physical contact. 

At least the day has been made by my mother greeting me at the gate in this outfit and demanding a hug!

We get home in time to hear Ramaphosa’s speech. Our DSTV decoder, injured during a play date, won’t come to life. There is rebooting, re-wiring, resignation. We opt for streaming. The speech is delayed by an hour and delayed again. Another hour later I give up and get on with Sunday evening chores. Dinner, hair washing all round, packing bags for school.

When I finally get a chance, the speech is history. I watch it anyway. It’s clear and decisive. More than I’d hoped for. There is a plan, and it starts tomorrow.
