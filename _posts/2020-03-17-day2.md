R is definitely going to school today. I make up some excuse to her about needing to pick up work for the holidays. In reality, I need to do more than type three emails today.

G is still poorly - leg cramps and high fever. Between keeping him medicated, hydrated and distracted I manage to send a few emails. At 11:55, five minutes before a telecon on remote teaching, I realize I am still in my pyjamas. Quick change.

I think I need to practise some social media distancing along with the social distancing. There is no news. The world has gone boring because everyone is staying at home. I check out the current flavor of shaming on Twitter. Even that’s become boring.

I am going to start a food garden. I figure this isolation is going to last at least three months and that will give me enough time to get a harvest, if I’m actually at home and remember to water the plants every now and again. Beetroots, carrots, mixed leaves, spinach and cauliflower. All things that can be sowed from seed in the autumn. 

Pick up R from school. That’s pretty much it for work so I give up and make granola. I’ve made enough to survive a viral holocaust, but haven’t left enough time to get dinner on the table. So we’re having muesli and yoghurt.

I call husband to find out when he’ll be home. Getting a bit of the old cabin fever now. I ask for both a distance and time estimate, which pisses him off. I almost asked for a traffic estimate too, but resigned myself to an extrapolation.

As soon as he walks in the door, I’m out to the beach with the dogs. Fresh air, good views. The beach is packed as lots of people have the same idea. Many families are together. I bump into a friend and we have a chat (2m apart), enjoying the gifts of health, Earth and friendship.
