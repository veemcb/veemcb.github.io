There is a feeling of mild excitement alongside the trepidation in the air. The school holidays have been extended to a month. I immediately make a list of all the wonderful outdoor, indoor and educational things we are going to do. I will be working from home. No matter, I can do it all. We decide the kids might as well stay home from today: R(6) has a sprained ankle and the sniffles anyway.

By 10:30am the cracks have started to appear. Turns out G(9) has picked up a particularly violent strain of the stomach flu and I have done little more than mop up bodily fluids. Fire off a quick few emails before a Zoom meeting at work to discuss the remote operation policy. “Do you think you will have any issues working from home?” Um, yes.

Husband and I cave and he goes to the wholesalers for some box milk, tins of chopped tomato and energy drink. Turns out we only saved R10.50 but wasted 1.5 hours in the queue. Also, he bought a 18-pack of toilet rolls, but I feel it’s justified given G’s condition.
